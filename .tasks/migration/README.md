## Instruction

This is an instruction how to solve the global task, decomposed into multiple smaller subtasks.

Go over tasks in order.

Once the task is completed:

- document the key findings and the acquired knowledge which can be used in future in `$TASK_NAME.outcome.md`. For
  example, `TASK_1.outcome.md`
- Mark the task as done in the Todo List, proceed to the next one.
- Git commit after every task, don't push.

This task is challenging, so be careful, and prefer deeper thinking if you're not sure about something.

**You're also on your own here**, and INSTRUCTOR won't be able to help, so don't ask any questions, just do you best to achieve the result.

If you need to install `cli` or any tool to achieve what you need - do it, you're in a safe environment.

## Todo List

- [x] ./TASK_1.md
- [x] ./TASK_2.md
- [x] ./TASK_3.md
- [x] ./TASK_4.md
