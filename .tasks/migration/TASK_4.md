Now you should have a tested, type-safe and working implementation for the library API upgrade. If you see things to improve/polish, now it's a good time for it.

If you have suggestions to improve the API itself, feel free to do it now. Just make sure all of the previous work is commited so INSTRUCTOR can review it easily.
